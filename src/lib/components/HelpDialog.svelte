  <h2>Controls Help</h2>
  <h4>Panning Modes</h4>
  <p>
    The control settings support two panning modes: "Screen Space" and "Elite Dangerous". The former
    defines left, right, up, down, forward, and backward based on the current view vector. It is
    recommended when the grid is disabled. The latter more closely reproduces what the game does and
    is more intuitive when the grid is on, as it follows the planes of the galactic coordinate
    system. You can choose freely which one you would like to use. However, touch screen devices
    should probably always keep this set to screen space.

  <ul class="list-disc pl-4">
    <li><kbd>Primary Mouse Button</kbd>: Rotate</li>
    <li><kbd>Secondary Mouse Button</kbd>: Pan (vertical)</li>
    <li>
      <kbd>Middle Mouse Button / Left+Right Mouse Buttons</kbd>: Pan (horizontal)
    </li>
    <li><kbd>Mouse Wheel</kbd>: Zoom</li>
    <li><kbd>W / A / S / D / R / F</kbd>: Pan</li>
    <li><kbd>Single Touch</kbd>: Rotate</li>
    <li><kbd>Double Touch</kbd>: Zoom and Pan (vertical)</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Measuring Distances</h4>
  <p>
    When "On System Click" is set to "Measure Distance", you can click on two systems on the map to
    measure the distance between them. The measured distance will be displayed in the bottom of the
    screen. Clicking on further systems will replace the measurement to go from the last system you
    clicked on to the new one. In order to hide a measurement, you can just click on the last system
    you clicked on a second time.
  </p>
  <h4>Other Hotkeys</h4>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-4">
    <li><kbd>c</kbd>: Toggle Controls Menu</li>
    <li><kbd>m</kbd>: Toggle Session Manager</li>
    <li><kbd>h</kbd>: Toggle Help</li>
    <li><kbd>g</kbd>: Toggle Grid</li>
    <li><kbd>p</kbd>: Toggle Performance Stats</li>
    <li>
      <kbd>1 to {Object.keys(ClickMode).length}</kbd>: Select the corresponding mode in "On System
      Click"
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>More Tricks</h4>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-4">
    <li>
      While the map is rendering, you can drag and drop system and faction links from INARA onto it
      to load data without having to use the inputs.
    </li>
    <li>
      When displaying Colonization ranges, there is a little download icon that you can click to
      import all potential colonization target systems within that sphere.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can also load the systems a faction is present in but not the controller of. To do so, add
      a space and "(NC)" (short for not controlled) to the faction name. E.g. loading "The Dark
      Wheel (NC)" will load all uncontrolled systems when just "The Dark Wheel" would load
      controlled systems. By loading both you can toggle and color things individually.<br />
      The reason this was not made accessible more easily is because I want people to consciously do
      it and be aware that loading presence systems can cause awkward overlaps when loading multiple
      factions that share common systems.
